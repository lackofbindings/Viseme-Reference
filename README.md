This document is a backup of the official [Meta Developer Documentation on Visemes](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/audio-ovrlipsync-viseme-reference/) in response to the notice that it may be removed from their site soon. This document is very important to VRChat avatar development so I thought it prudent to create this backup.
